# BASIC DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIER
## Aim:
To design and analyse the MOS Differential Amplifier
## COMPONENTS REQUIRED:
* N Channel Mosfet (nmos4)
* Resistor (1.14k, 327.8)
* Voltage source
* Current source
* Signal Generator
# THEORY:
A MOS differential amplifier amplifies the difference between two input signals while rejecting common-mode signals. It uses two MOSFETs biased in the saturation region, acting as controlled current sources.
* Differential Mode: The output voltage is proportional to the difference in input voltages, given by Vout= gm x (Vin1 - Vin2) where gm is transconductance and Rd is the load resistance.
* Common-Mode: If the inputs are the same, the output ideally is zero, rejecting common-mode signals.
This amplifier is used in applications like operational amplifiers, where noise rejection and differential signal amplification are needed.
